# WikiSite
This wiki site was a wiki site created for my web development module in the second year of university. 

The intention behind this assignment was to create a website using an MVC framework and demonstrating it within site. 

The technology stack for this website is:
* PHP 7
* Code Igniter
* Mysql
* Javascript
